""""""""""""
Overview
""""""""""""

The 2017 Graduate Student Colloquium will be held in the 541 Deike Building, University Park and is open to the public.

The Graduate Student Colloquium is a forum where students present their research or research proposal to faculty, friends, and peers.

The Colloquium is hosted by the Department of Geosciences and is open to graduate students involved in geoscience research.

The colloquium format stimulates research discussion, allows students to practice for national meetings, and helps students improve their speaking skills.

The Colloquium helps both the Department of Geosciences and PennState to maintain and strengthen their reputations at national meetings for giving high quality talks and posters with visual appeal.



The Graduate Colloquium Committee wishes to thank in advance the students for sharing their work and the faculty for giving constructive advice.
The Committee also wishes to thank the Shell People Services Division of Shell Oil Company and the Department of Geosciences
for their donations of prize money and their generous financial support.
