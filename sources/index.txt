""""""""""""
Overview
""""""""""""

The 2018 Graduate Student Colloquium will be held the 22nd and 23rd of March in the Pulse of the Earth (240 Deike Building).

The Graduate Student Colloquium is a student-organized annual event that celebrates the research accomplishments of our graduate student community. This event is hosted by the Department of Geosciences and is open to all graduate students involved in geosciences related research.
The Graduate Student Colloquium provides all of us with an opportunity to present our research to the department, receive feedback from faculty judges and peers, and compete for monetary prizes. The colloquium format also stimulates research discussion, and helps students improve their communication skills and think about the broader implications of their work.

The `abstract submission <./02SignUp/index.html>`__ deadline for this year's colloquium will be February 23rd at 5pm. All are encouraged to participate; presentations on research in progress are welcome. If you would like to submit entries to the `photo contest <./02SignUp/index.html>`__ or `t-shirt design contest <./02SignUp/index.html>`__ , they will also be due on February 23rd at 5pm.A series of events will take place prior to the Graduate Student Colloquium including a presentation on “how to give a good talk and poster”. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Graduate Colloquium, we are also organizing a series of special events including some short talks from some departmental alumni on “how to have a successful career in the geosciences” and a reception in the EMS museum. Make sure to join us to be part of the celebrations! For more information on those events, see our online schedule.
The Graduate Colloquium Committee wishes to thank in advance the students and faculty for their participation. The Committee also wishes to thank the Shell People Services Division of Shell Oil Company; the Department of Geosciences for their donations of prize money and their generous financial support; and Dave Cannon and his family for their generous donation towards the graduate colloquium awards.
